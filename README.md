# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Semantic Search Assignment  

This repository contains my solution for the **Semantic Search on Movie Plots Assignment**.  
The goal was to build a semantic search engine that retrieves movies based on the *meaning* of a query instead of just keyword matches.  

The project uses **SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** for embeddings and **cosine similarity** for ranking results.  
All work was completed step by step as per the assignment instructions, tested with unit tests, and verified using **GitHub Actions CI/CD**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview  

- **Objective**: Implement a semantic search engine for movie plots.  
- **Model Used**: SentenceTransformers â†’ `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.  
- **Similarity Measure**: Cosine similarity on embeddings.  
- **Evaluation**: Verified with unit tests (`tests/test_movie_search.py`).  
- **Automation**: Continuous testing with GitHub Actions.  

This project demonstrates NLP, embeddings, semantic retrieval, unit testing, and GitHub workflows.

## âœ¨ Features  

- Load `movies.csv` dataset into Pandas.  
- Generate embeddings for each movie plot.  
- Implement `search_movies(query, top_n)` to return top matches.  
- All **4 unit tests** passing:
  - Output format  
  - Top N correctness  
  - Similarity ranking  
  - Semantic relevance  
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing.
